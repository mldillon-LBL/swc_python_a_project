It looks like someone just found a salty subsurface lake on Mars.
Downloaded the Science Report, but haven't read it yet.
The lake appears to be under the ice cap.
It's an Italian group, probably satellite study? Or maybe they're using JMars
How salty is that water?
It's very salty
I wonder what the water activity is like
